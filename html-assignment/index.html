            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi and welcome to my site. I'm Evan, the web developer for this page. I have recently found a love for
                coding even though we have only just begun learning the basics. I cannot wait to move to CSS and fully
                be able to design my future sites. Before coming to <em>Algonquin</em> I was a student at <em>Carleton
                    University</em> finishing my degree with a bachelor in <strong>Global and International
                    Studies</strong>. However, While I finished the program, I realized that the line of work that came
                with it was not something I could see myself doing for a career. Instead, I think I am better suited for
                something creative, engaging, and more hands on so that is why I chose to take <abbr

            <h2>My Hobbies (cont'd.)</h2>
            <p>One of my favourite things to do in my free time is collect old and sealed videogame merchandise. I
                specifically enjoy all things anime, <em>Nintendo</em>, and <em>Pokémon</em>. I have a huge selection of
                modern, vintage and Japanese <em>Pokémon</em> cards and they vary in prices. The original Pokémon games
                were really nostalgic to me and I love turning on my old DS to play when I'm bored. My most recent
                purchase was a metallic DS that I bought for my girlfriend to use and play with me. I bought it on
                September 20<sup>th</sup> off <em>Facebook marketplace</em>.</p>
